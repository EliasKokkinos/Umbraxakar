			<p>Shadows now bow to your will, for the Shadowthrone mark is upon your soul. You gain the following benefits:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Whenever you take the Hide action and successfully become undetected, you can move normally up to 30 feet before losing the benefits of being hidden.</li>
				<li>You can cast Duskwalk once without expending a spell slot. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for this spell. You canâ€™t do so again until you finish a short or long rest.</li>
			</ul>
