			<p class="flavor">You have the ability to burn Steel.<b><i>This spell is only available to Mistborn. </i></b></p>
			<p>Coinshots can "Push" on nearby metals. This can allow them to make metallic objects that weigh 
				less than they do to fly through the air away from them (using coins, for instance, as weapons). For metallic objects which weigh more than they do, 
				this can cause them to be pushed away from the object. It was generally assumed that a Coinshot could not Push on metals that pierce or are otherwise 
				contained in the body of another (e.g., ingested metals).</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Pushing. </i></b>You can push the equivalent to your weight practically 40 feet.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Coinshot. </i></b>Replace one or more Attacks with coinshot, where you can hurl a number of coins, or other similarly shaped metal, 
			equal to your intelligence modifier (minimum of 1) towards an enemy at a distance of up to 60 feet causing 1d12 piercing damage for each coin. </p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Metallic Hail. </i></b>As an Action direct a hail of metallic shards (usually coins) at a point of at least 20 feet away from you, 
			to a max of 60 feet. Each creature in a 5-foot-radius sphere centered on that point, OR in the path of the shards/coins, must make a Dexterity saving throw
			 equal to your Character Level + Proficiency Bonus. A target takes 4d12 piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. 
			 The coins/shards land at that sphere and can be used in subsequent turns by Allomancers. </p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Metal Haze. </i></b>As a Bonus Action push metallic dust into the eyes of a creature withing 10 feet. The creature must succeed on a 
			constitution saving throw equal to your Character Level + Proficiency Bonus or be blinded. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of their round.</p>

			<p>Lurchers have the ability to burn Iron, which allows them to Pull on nearby metals.

			move 40 feet to any direction. You must be a minimum of 120 feet from 2 metal objects to achieve this. (this put usual achievable hover height to about 60 feet)
			You require both metals burning to stabilize your hovering. Falling unconscious or becoming unable to burn iron and steel at the same time stops this effect. 
			You can safely land if you can reduce your falling rate with only one metal burning.</p>

			<p class="flavor">You have the ability to burn Pewter.<b><i>This spell is only available to Mistborn. </i></b></p>
			<p>Pewterarms, or Thugs, have the ability to burn Pewter, which allows them to greatly enhance their physical capabilities. 
			While burning pewter, a Thug can fight or perform physical labor longer than any normal person, and is also many times stronger than his or her normal self. 
			This enhanced strength also allows a Thug to shrug off wounds that would kill or incapacitate a normal person. Pewter-burning also provides a Thug with an 
			increased sense of balance and vastly increased speed and dexterity. 
			</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Thug. </i></b>Dexterity and strength increase temporarily by 4. Similarly your movement speed increases by 20 feet and carrying capacity doubles. After completing 
			the burn the user must succeed a DC 15 or suffer a level of exhaustion. For every extra pewter bead burned withing the next 10 minutes the DC increases by 5 and the level of exhaustion by 1. </p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Pewter drag. (lasts 20 min per bead, requires concentration)</i></b>Increase only movement speed by 40 feet and triple your carrying capacity for a significantly longer period. After completing 
			the burn the user must succeed a DC 15 or suffer a level of exhaustion. For every extra pewter bead burned withing the next 10 minutes the DC increases by 5 and the level of exhaustion by 1.</p>
