	<element name="Dragons Fury Tattoo" type="Magic Item" source="Book of the Fallen" id="ID_BOTF_CUSTOM_MISC_ITEM_TATTOO_DRAGONS_FURY_TATTOO">
		<description>
			<p>Produced by a special needle, this magic tattoo evokes fury in its form and colors.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Tattoo Attunement.</em></strong> To attune to this item, you hold the needle to your skin where you want the tattoo to activate, pressing the needle there throughout the attunement process. When the attunement is complete.</p>
			<p class="indent">If your attunement to the tattoo ends, the tattoo vanishes, and the needle reappears in your space.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Bloodthirsty Strikes.</em></strong> The tattoo has 10 charges, and it regains all expended charges daily at dawn. While this tattoo is on your skin, you gain the following benefits:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend a charge to deal an extra 4d6 Kurald Emurlahn damage to the target, and you regain a number of hit points equal to the Kurald Emurlahn damage dealt.</li>
				<li>When a creature you can see damages you, you can expend a charge and use your reaction to make a melee attack against that creature, with advantage on your attack roll.</li>
			</ul>

	<element name="Talons Glamoured Studded Leather" type="Magic Item" source="Book of the Fallen" id="ID_BOTF_CUSTOM_MAGIC_ITEM_GLAMOURED_STUDDED_LEATHER">
		<description>
			<p>While wearing this armor, you gain a +2 bonus to AC. 
			You can also use a bonus action to speak the armor's command word and cause the armor to assume the appearance 
			of a normal set of clothing or some other kind of armor. You decide what it looks like, including color, style, and accessories, 
			but the armor retains its normal bulk and weight. The illusory appearance lasts until you use this property again or remove the armor.
			Talons use the Glamored Armor to create the facade that vital body parts are exposed, while truly there is armor beneath the illussion. 
			Enemies that know or can see through through this trick render the extra +1 AC irrelevant and reduce the effectictive bonus to +1.
