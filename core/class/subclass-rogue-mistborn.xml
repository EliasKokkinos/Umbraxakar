            <p>Some are born Mistoborns, others are made through a secretive ritual, consuming a bead of Lerasium, giving them the ability to consume and burn metals to access an unknown magic source, very rarely seen before.</p>
            <p class="indent">Mistborns are usually secretive individuals who closely guard their secrets since obscurity and misinterpretation of their powers gives them a great advantage in combat.
            Another reason for this secrecy is the very real weaknesses of Mistborns, that are sometimes hidden or not shared with other Mistborns. Mistborns distrust and avoid others of their kind, 
            since they represent the most dangerous enemies to them.</p>
            <p class="indent">As a Mistborn, you almost never unleash your true potential or share your true capabilities with anyone. Mistborns have hunted and killed others for less.
            You exploit your obscure magic to catch enemies off guard and to enhance your preexisting skills to become an unmatched force in the battlefield.</p>
