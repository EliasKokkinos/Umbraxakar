        <strong>
          <em>Gift of Draconus.</em>
        </strong> Any creature slain by the sword can have their soul pulled into it. This is a punishment reserved for the most wretched creatures
      </p>

        <strong>
          <em>Disheartening Strike.</em>
        </strong> When you hit a creature with an attack using this weapon, you can fill the target with unsettling dread: the target has disadvantage on the next saving throw it makes before the end of your next turn. The creature ignores this effect if it’s immune to the frightened condition. Once you use this property, you can’t do so again until the next dusk.
